- _struct_spec_pydantic.py: Pydantic models support
- _struct_spec_flax.py: Flax-specific utilities

The main _struct_spec.py file now focuses on core registry functionality and
registers rules from the extension modules. This makes the codebase more

Problem:
Currently map layer visibility settings are stored in user preferences, making
it impossible for new layers to be visible to existing users, as the app copies
the defaults into user preferences which are then never updated.

Solution:
- Move layer visibility configurations from defaultPreferences.config.ts to
  a dedicated sectionLayers export in layers.config.ts
- Update TransitionMainMap to use this configuration first, with fallback to
  user preferences for backward compatibility
- Remove layer configuration from default preferences
- Add unit tests to validate the changes

This change ensures new layers will be visible to all users while maintaining
backward compatibility.

Fix memory leak in Cache and SQLList classes

This commit addresses memory leaks related to SQLAlchemy resources not being properly released. Key changes:

1. Added close() method to Cache class to properly dispose of SQLAlchemy engines
2. Added __del__ method to Cache for resource cleanup during garbage collection
3. Modified Cache.__exit__ to call close() for proper context manager cleanup
4. Added close() and __del__ methods to SQLiteDict for engine disposal
5. Improved SQLList.__cleanup() to properly dispose engines and remove circular refs
6. Modified profiling script to use context managers for reliable cleanup

The fixes ensure SQLAlchemy resources are properly released between runs,
preventing memory leaks when running multiple jobs in sequence.

This commit enhances the infrastructure management UI to leverage the improved worker identification in the backend:

1. Updated the Worker interface to include new fields:
   - displayName: formatted worker name (container@hostname)
   - containerName: container part of the worker name
   - nodeName: node/hostname part of the worker name

2. Enhanced the UI to display and utilize the new fields:
   - Added dedicated columns for Node and Container in the workers table
   - Added Worker Info section in the expanded view showing container and node details
   - Updated worker display to use displayName when available

3. Added new sorting and filtering capabilities:
   - Sort workers by node or container
   - Search by node name or container name

4. Fixed field naming to consistently use camelCase throughout the component

These changes align with backend improvements that enhance worker identification by using
a standardized naming format (CONTAINER@HOSTNAME) to improve observability and management.

sakaiproject,sakai,13513,https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/13513,MERGED,1,0,1,1,1,"SAK-46662 Fix constraint violation during site copy of assignments

Fix a constraint violation error that occurs during site copy operations when copying assignments
with AllPurposeItem supplements. The error occurred because the AssignmentAllPurposeItem was being
saved to the database before its required assignmentId field was set.

This fix removes the premature save operation and ensures the entity is only saved after all required
fields are properly initialized.
